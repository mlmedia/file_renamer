# File renamer script (PHP)
This little project contains a PHP shell script to non-destructively copy a source directory and recursively rename all directories and files in the destination directory. while also updating records in a MySQL database.

## NOTE
This project has been *somewhat* depracated by a parallel Bash file renamer script found here: https://github.com/mlmedia/script-bash-file-renamer. Current PHP frameworks also handle data updates better with migrations and similar techniques.
